# Coursework Modules
The modules I used were Pygame and CSV

py -m pip install pygame

This installs the pygame module to python, and can be called as "import pygame" 

What my coursework project does:
    1) When the game is opened, it creates a window that brings you to a main menu.
    2) From this main menu, you can either choose to start the game or go to the leaderboard.
    3) If the leaderboard is chosen, a new screen is shown which displays the scoreboard.
    4) Once the player goes back to the menu, they can click enter to initialise the main game.
    5) The aim of the game is to survive the waves, and see how many points they can get in one run.
    6) Once the player runs out of HP, they will die, and the game loop ends.
    7) When that happens, the game will ask for user input in the IDLE screen for your name.
    8) Once the name has been set, the game will write the name and points total to a csv file.
    9) This then brings you to the game over screen, thanks you for playing, and promptly quits.
    10) If the game is reopened for a second try, the user can see that their name and score has been
        saved in the leaderboard (granted they get a high enough score.)

This project would not have been completed, had I not been able to get help online, and I have linked down all
of my sources that I used to help me in the folder named "Things that taught me pygame and python", each link in
the folder helped me learn how to create classes, variables and objects specified to my needs in pygame, and each
link has been useful for guiding me.
