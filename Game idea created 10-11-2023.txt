What i want to do for my game:

Setting:

Wild west cowboy in a town full of undead




Survival Shooter where the difficulty increases each wave, the game will be set all in one screen, with multiple openings for enemies to come by.

player is limited to 4 hits, upon being killed, the time spent alive + the score is tracked on a leaderboard of 10 players

enemies have a small chance of dropping health, but with the quantity of enemies, should be easy to regain health. Player will have invincibility frames for 3 seconds upon being hit

5 Types of enemies
Running - 100pts - 3 hits to kill
Slow walking but tanky - 200pts - 10 hits to kill
Flying - 300pts - 3 hits to kill
Underground - 300pts - 5 hits to kill, 1.5 second delay from surfacing to hitting player
Ranged - 150pts - 2 hits to kill, fires 1 time a second

a highscore system that keeps track of 10 of the highest scores

multiple powerups that can be stacked up to a limit of 2, and used with keys

- nuke: kills in a 10x10 tile radius (game will be 100x100 tiles)
- extra life: rare spawn, can't be used as a powerup, is used automatically upon death
- shotgun: fires 5 bullets in a random spray pattern in the direction you are facing
- minigun: rapidfire of bullets
- shield: protects from any one type of hit taken
- speed shoes: makes the player run much faster
- freeze: enemies slow down extremely for 5 seconds





movement using WASD, and the mouse to aim and shoot projectiles, players' main gun will be a pistol that shoots 3 bullets a second, maybe change this later.

no story (yet) just one big level where waves of monsters come in
